Dear Dr. Sarajedini,

We thank you for organizing the review of our paper, and also
thank the referee for constructive criticism.  We have considered
the referee's remarks carefully and revised our manuscript
accordingly.

Below, we have reproduced the relevant portions of the referee's
report, alongside our responses. A list of changes is appended to
the manuscript using the trackchanges AASTeX macros. Figures
supporting X AND Y WORDS TODO FIX THESE have also been uploaded for inspection.

Sincerely,

REFEREE COMMENT
----------
At this stage the referee is more inclined to believe that the authors have
identified a set of young stars in that region of the sky than actual halo
member stars of NGC 2516.

REFEREE COMMENT
----------
The authors begin by concatenating a very large collection of stars identified by
CG18 (which they term the core members), and those of KC19 and M21, the last two
having very relaxed criteria for association with NGC 2516.
At this stage, as one can see from the distributions in Fig.1, the sample is
completely bloated with field stars which now clearly have to be excised.
The question is how?

The authors justifiably look first to the HR diagram and understandably find
that that is not very helpful in rejecting non-members because almost all stars in
the extended sample lie close to the ridge line of the canonical cluster members.
(Nevertheless, this is already a basis for rejecting stars below the main sequence
and those significantly above it, including giants. The authors should consider
this.) Incidentally, the Gaia photometry for the brightest stars is likely not good
enough for fitting any isochrones of this age, so in this referee's estimation, the
cluster turnoff is perhaps still the best one can do, keeping in mind the persistence
of photometric problems for bright stars.

RESPONSE

REFEREE COMMENT
----------
The authors then go on to consider the rotation periods and lithium abundances
of the extended sample, to compare them with previously-known distribution of
similarly young stars.

The conceptual problem here is that stars that deviate from the known/expected
rotational distribution for NGC 2516 are again not excised from the sample.  As
prior studies (e.g. Fritzewski+2020) have shown, there are no rotators above
the slow sequence in NGC 2516. So such stars most certainly have to be excised
from further consideration. (Some of these are even older than Praesepe, as the
authors themselves show in Fig.4.) The authors should consider whether other
regions of the color-period diagram merit similar treatment.

******************************************
REFEREE COMMENT
----------
An additional concern is that the authors construct two samples A (where rotation
periods from multiple types of measurements don't agree) and B (where rotation
periods agree), but then go further with sample A (for instance Fig.6).
Had the authors gone forward with the tightest-possible sample, and had then
shown that this tight rotation-lithium sample still has a far greater extent on
sky and in the canonical parallax, proper motion, RV etc. spaces, then readers would
be far more willing to believe the authors' claims about a more extensive cluster.


RESPONSE
----------

******************************************
REFEREE COMMENT
----------
The referee notes that the prior work of Healy & McCullough 2020, who also used
TESS data to measure a sizeable group of stars in NGC 2516 has been completely
ignored. The authors should include a discussion of the H+M2020 work in relation
to the results in this paper.

RESPONSE
----------

******************************************
REFEREE COMMENT
----------
While on the subject, it should also be mentioned that the Introduction of the
paper is only from the galactic structure perspective, and is lacking in
introducing readers to the rotation-lithium perspective. Given that the latter
constitute the bulk of the paper, doing that would clearly help the argument
being laid out.

RESPONSE
----------

******************************************
REFEREE COMMENT
----------
This referee came away with the general impression that the authors have likely
identified a number of young stars in a vast halo around NGC 2516, but did not
find the association with NGC 2516 itself to be particularly convincing.
Perhaps they can think about how to make their arguments tighter, and the
inclusion criterea stricter in the next iteration, to be able to better convince
the community of the association with NGC 2516.

DATA EDITOR'S COMMENT
----------
The .csv file attached with Table 1 has a large number of significant digits in
most columns. In the revised manuscript, the authors should include a new
version that has only the required precision. This document outlines the
typical uncertainties for Gaia data:

https://gea.esac.esa.int/archive/documentation/GDR2/

Fewer significant digits will result in a smaller file that will be easier to
read, manipulate, and transfer.

RESPONSE
----------
> The CSV file has been updated with an appropriate number of significant
> digits in each column; thank you for the suggestion.
