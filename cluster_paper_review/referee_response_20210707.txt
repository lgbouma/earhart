Dear Dr. Sarajedini,

We thank you for organizing the review of our paper, and also thank
the referee for constructive criticism.  We have considered the
referee's remarks carefully and revised our manuscript accordingly.

Below, we have reproduced the relevant portions of the referee's
report, alongside our responses. A list of changes is appended to
the manuscript using the trackchanges AASTeX macros
(ms_trackchanges.pdf). A figure expanding on the comparison between
the field and cluster star rotation periods has also been uploaded
for inspection (f13_corehalosplit.png).

Sincerely,

Luke Bouma

REFEREE COMMENT
----------
At this stage the referee is more inclined to believe that the
authors have identified a set of young stars in that region of the
sky than actual halo member stars of NGC 2516.

REFEREE COMMENT
----------
The authors begin by concatenating a very large collection of stars
identified by CG18 (which they term the core members), and those of
KC19 and M21, the last two having very relaxed criteria for
association with NGC 2516.  At this stage, as one can see from the
distributions in Fig.1, the sample is completely bloated with field
stars which now clearly have to be excised.  The question is how?

The authors justifiably look first to the HR diagram and
understandably find that that is not very helpful in rejecting
non-members because almost all stars in the extended sample lie
close to the ridge line of the canonical cluster members.
(Nevertheless, this is already a basis for rejecting stars below the
main sequence and those significantly above it, including giants.
The authors should consider this.) Incidentally, the Gaia photometry
for the brightest stars is likely not good enough for fitting any
isochrones of this age, so in this referee's estimation, the cluster
turnoff is perhaps still the best one can do, keeping in mind the
persistence of photometric problems for bright stars.

******************************************
REFEREE COMMENT
----------
The authors then go on to consider the rotation periods and lithium
abundances of the extended sample, to compare them with
previously-known distribution of similarly young stars.

The conceptual problem here is that stars that deviate from the
known/expected rotational distribution for NGC 2516 are again not
excised from the sample.  As prior studies (e.g. Fritzewski+2020)
have shown, there are no rotators above the slow sequence in NGC
2516. So such stars most certainly have to be excised from further
consideration. (Some of these are even older than Praesepe, as the
authors themselves show in Fig.4.) The authors should consider
whether other regions of the color-period diagram merit similar
treatment.

REFEREE COMMENT
----------
An additional concern is that the authors construct two samples A
(where rotation periods from multiple types of measurements don't
agree) and B (where rotation periods agree), but then go further
with sample A (for instance Fig.6).  Had the authors gone forward
with the tightest-possible sample, and had then shown that this
tight rotation-lithium sample still has a far greater extent on sky
and in the canonical parallax, proper motion, RV etc. spaces, then
readers would be far more willing to believe the authors' claims
about a more extensive cluster.

******************************************
REFEREE COMMENT
----------
The referee notes that the prior work of Healy & McCullough 2020,
who also used TESS data to measure a sizeable group of stars in NGC
2516 has been completely ignored. The authors should include a
discussion of the H+M2020 work in relation to the results in this
paper.

REFEREE COMMENT
----------
While on the subject, it should also be mentioned that the
Introduction of the paper is only from the galactic structure
perspective, and is lacking in introducing readers to the
rotation-lithium perspective. Given that the latter constitute the
bulk of the paper, doing that would clearly help the argument being
laid out.

RESPONSE
----------

******************************************
REFEREE COMMENT
----------
This referee came away with the general impression that the authors
have likely identified a number of young stars in a vast halo around
NGC 2516, but did not find the association with NGC 2516 itself to
be particularly convincing.  Perhaps they can think about how to
make their arguments tighter, and the inclusion criteria stricter in
the next iteration, to be able to better convince the community of
the association with NGC 2516.

DATA EDITOR'S COMMENT
----------
The .csv file attached with Table 1 has a large number of
significant digits in most columns. In the revised manuscript, the
authors should include a new version that has only the required
precision. This document outlines the typical uncertainties for Gaia
data:

https://gea.esac.esa.int/archive/documentation/GDR2/

Fewer significant digits will result in a smaller file that will be
easier to read, manipulate, and transfer.
