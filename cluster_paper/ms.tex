  Recent analyses of the Gaia data have reported the existence of
  diffuse stellar populations surrounding nearby open clusters.  It is
  important to verify that these ``halos'', ``tails'', and ``strings''
  are of similar ages and compositions as stars in the denser part of
  the cluster.  We present an analysis of NGC\,2516
  ($\approx$150\,Myr), which has a classical tidal radius of 10\,pc
  and an apparent halo of stars spanning 500\,pc.  Combining
  photometry from Gaia, rotation periods from TESS, and lithium
  measurements from Gaia-ESO and GALAH, we find that the halo of
  NGC\,2516 is real and coeval with the core.  Two thirds of
  kinematically selected halo members out to 250\,pc from the cluster
  center have rotation periods consistent with a gyrochronological age
  of 150\,Myr.  A comparison sample of field stars shows no such
  trend.  In addition, the lithium abundances of stars in the halo are
  elevated relative to the field, and are correlated with the stellar
  rotation rate in a manner consistent with previous observations of
  the Pleiades and Psc\,Eri.  Broadly speaking, this work advances the
  paradigm in which the halos of many open clusters are more populous
  than their cores.  We highlight the implications for spectroscopic
  survey targeting, open cluster dispersal, and planet searches around
  young stars.

\section{Introduction}

Star clusters form when dense filaments in hierarchically structured
molecular clouds collide and collapse \citep{shu_star_1987}.  Over the
first 10\,Myr, feedback effects including protostellar outflows,
photoionization, radiation pressure, and supernova shocks disperse the
gas out of the cloud \citep{krumholz_star_2019}.  Since only $\sim
1\%$ of the cloud mass is converted into stars, gas dispersal enables
the majority ($\sim$90\%) of stars in the cluster to escape the
cluster's gravitational well \citep{lada_embedded_2003}.

From 10 to 1000\,Myr, the cluster remnants that survive gas dispersal
suffer an onslaught that almost always leads to dissolution.  Inside
the cluster supernovae, AGB winds, and close stellar encounters lead
to additional mass loss \citep{lamers_mass_loss_2010}.  Extrinsic to
the cluster, collisions with giant molecular clouds
\citep{spitzer_disruption_1958}, and perturbations from the galactic
tide in both the radial and vertical dimensions further promote
stellar escape \citep[{\it
e.g.},][]{fukushige_timescale_2000,bergond_gravitational_2001}.

Finding the stars that have dispersed from their natal clusters into
the galactic field is a pressing topic for a few reasons.  One is to
understand the spatial extent and duration of star formation events
\citep[{\it e.g.},][]{wright_kinematics_2018}.  Another is to
understand the Sun's birth environment \citep{adams_birth_2010}.  Did
the Sun form in an open cluster, and if so, what type? Is there any
hope at identifying the stars that formed near the Sun?  Open clusters
and their dispersed remnants also provide a test case for ``chemical
tagging'' \citep[{\it
e.g.},][]{freeman_new_2002,hogg_chemical_2016,ness_dopplergangers_2018}.
The converse holds too: one can use chemical tagging to test the
viability of kinematic clustering methods.

A separate project that benefits from the new discoveries of dispersed
stellar populations is that of finding young transiting exoplanets.
Young transiting planets are hard to find because young stars are
rare, and mostly reside in the crowded galactic plane \citep[see {\it
e.g.},][]{Kharchenko_et_al_2013,piskunov_global_2018}.  If the
dispersed halos of nearby star clusters could be reliably identified,
this could expand the census of nearby young stars by up to a factor
of $10$, based on the expected fraction of stars thought to be lost
during gas dispersal.

The detection of dispersed stellar associations, although possible
before Gaia, has now reached a breakthrough pace \citep[{\it
e.g.},][]{de_zeeuw_hipparcos_1999,bergond_gravitational_2001,zuckerman_young_2004,oh_comoving_2017,cantatgaudin_gaia_2018,gagne_banyan_XII_2018,gagne_banyan_XIII_2018,kounkel_apogee2_2018,zari_3d_2018,kounkel_untangling_2019,furnkranz_comabernbhr_2019}.
The populations found by these studies can be summarized as follows.
On one end are coeval groups with no discernable cores ({\it e.g.},
Psc Eri and $\mu$ Tau,
\citealt{meingast_psceri_2019,curtis_tess_2019,gagne_mutau_2020}).  On
the other are hierarchically structured associations with many over
and under-densities  \citep[{\it e.g.} the Sco-Cen and Vela
associations][]{pecaut_star_2016,cantatgaudin_velaOB2_2019}.  Here, we focus on
an intermediate regime: low-density halos associated with a single
overdensity, typically an open cluster that was known before Gaia
\citep[see][]{kounkel_untangling_2019,kounkel_untanglingII_2020,meingast_2021}.
In some cases, these halos could correspond to tidal tails, as have
been reported in the Hyades
\citep{meingast_hyades_2019,roser_hyades_2019}, the Ursa Major moving
group \citep{gagne_lowmassUMA_2020}, and in Coma Berenices
\citep{tang_comaber_2019}. 

One point of difficulty however is that different clustering methods
yield differing levels of sensitivity and precision
\citep{hunt_clustering_2020}.  Using say a Gaussian Mixture Model
tautologically yields open clusters that are elliptical \citep[{\it
e.g.},][]{wallace_m4_2018}.  Some unsupervised methods yield dispersed
and asymmetric structures with number densities down to 100 times less
than the field around the same regions (see {\it e.g.},
\citealt{kounkel_untangling_2019} and \citealt{meingast_2021}).
Differences between different clustering methods raise the issue of
how contaminated the resulting samples are, and in some cases whether
the reported structures are truly coeval stellar populations at all.

We have recently been making TESS light curves of stars reported to be
members of coeval populations (CDIPS, \citealt{bouma_cdipsI_2019}).
Our analysis of TESS Sectors 1-13 yielded light curves of
\numsouthernuniqlcs\ candidate cluster members in the Southern Ecliptic
hemisphere, which are available on
MAST\footnote{\url{https://archive.stsci.edu/hlsp/cdips}}.

As part of this broader project, we focus here on a modest question:
in just a single southern open cluster, is the cluster halo truly
coeval with the core?  We chose NGC\,2516 for this analysis since it
is young (100--200\,Myr) and sufficiently nearby ($d\approx400$\,pc)
to facilitate photometric rotation measurements using TESS.  Its halo
was recently reported by \citet{kounkel_untangling_2019} to span
$\approx20\times10\times350$\,pc.  We want to know: is this halo real?
To what extent can we use Gaia alone to reliably identify age-dated
needles in the haystack of field stars?  What are the implications,
observationally and theoretically, if we can identify the dispersed
halos of open clusters?

A brief note on terminology.  Low-density stellar associations
connected to a dense population (a ``core'') have been described as
being in ``halos'', ``strings'', ``coronae'', ``snakes'',
``outskirts'', and ``tidal tails'' \citep[{\it
e.g.},][]{davenport_death_2010,kounkel_untangling_2019,roser_hyades_2019,tian_discovery_2020,meingast_2021}.
The latter term implies a particular model for the formation of the
dispersed group.  ``Halo'' is concise and model agnostic, but suffers
from the suggestion of spherical symmetry.  The halo of NGC\,2516 is
most accurately described as consisting of a leading and trailing
tail. However, the goal of this study is to clarify whether the stars
in these tails are the same age as stars in the core, and not to make
a ruling on the origin of the overall structure.  For this reason, we
adopt the model-agnostic ``halo''.

Section~\ref{sec:gaia} summarizes the astrometric analyses of the Gaia
data that led to our interest in \cn.  Section~\ref{sec:agedate}
measures the age of the cluster's halo and core using Gaia photometry
(Section~\ref{subsec:hr}), TESS gyrochronology
(Section~\ref{subsec:tess}), and lithium depletion
(Section~\ref{subsec:lithium}).  In Section~\ref{sec:discussion} we
discuss the implications of our analysis for NGC\,2516 specifically
and stellar spin-down and open cluster evolution generally.
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} gives our conclusions.

  \caption{ {\bf The dense and diffuse components of NGC\,2516 across
  position and velocity space.} The core (black) was analyzed by
  \citet{cantatgaudin_gaia_2018} using Gaia DR2, and is coincident
  with the visual overdensity of stars canonically accepted as ``the
  cluster''.  The halo (blue) is a concatenation of the studies by
  \citet{kounkel_untangling_2019} and \citet{meingast_2021}, which
  used less restrictive membership assignment algorithms described in
  Appendix~\ref{app:clustering}.  The field sample is randomly drawn
  from a $(\alpha, \delta, \pi)$ cube centered on the cluster.  The
  low volume density of the halo stars makes it difficult to visually
  distinguish the field and the halo samples.

  Points denote halo members with $\pi/\sigma_\pi>20$.  In our
  galactic coordinate system, the Sun is at $\{X,Y,Z\} = \{ -8122, 0,
  +20.8\}\,{\rm pc}$.  The gray line traces the past and future
  cluster orbit.  In different projections, the gray line spans
  different time intervals: the longest time window is visible in the
  $(Z,X)$ projection.  The large blue arrows denote the median cluster
  velocity after subtracting the local standard of rest: $\{v_{\rm X},
  v_{\rm Y}, v_{\rm Z}\} = \{-22.2, -25.3, -4.6\}$\kms.   By
  comparison, $\vec{v}_{\rm LSR} = \{12.9, 245.6, 7.78\}$\kms; in the
  inertial frame of the Galaxy, \cn\ is moving mostly in the $\hat{Y}$
  direction.  The sizes of the blue arrows are internally
  proportionate. 
  \label{fig:XYZ}

\end{figure*}

We selected candidate \cn\ members based on those reported in the
literature.  While some pre-Gaia analyses were available
\citep{jeffries_ngc2516_2001,Kharchenko_et_al_2013}, the purity and
accuracy of the Gaia-derived results are the current state of the art.
We therefore adopted what we viewed as the most important clustering
samples to compare: those of \citet{cantatgaudin_gaia_2018},
\citet{kounkel_untangling_2019} and \citet{meingast_2021}.  We refer
to these studies in the following as
\citetalias{cantatgaudin_gaia_2018},
\citetalias{kounkel_untangling_2019}, and \citetalias{meingast_2021}
respectively.  A useful visualization of these samples is
available online\footnote{
  \url{https://homepage.univie.ac.at/stefan.meingast/coronae.html},
  made by \citet{meingast_2021}, last accessed \texttt{2021/04/05}.}.
While we considered performing our own clustering analysis on the
Gaia data, such an effort would in effect only replicate the work of
these investigators.  We opt to instead use their studies as a starting
point.

The Gaia clustering studies each used different selection functions,
which yielded different results.  \citetalias{cantatgaudin_gaia_2018}
considered stars brighter than $G=18$\,mag within a few degrees of the
center of \cn, and reported 1106 candidate cluster members.
\citetalias{kounkel_untangling_2019} and \citetalias{meingast_2021}
considered stars up to $\approx$1\,mag fainter, and reported 3003 and
1860 members respectively.  The unsupervised clustering techniques
that each of these studies applied to the second Gaia data release are
discussed in Appendix~\ref{app:clustering}, as is the overlap between
their resulting membership catalogs.

Figure~\ref{fig:gaia6d} shows the cluster members reported by each
study in the space of observed positions, proper motions, and radial
velocity when available.
In Figure~\ref{fig:gaia6d}, and for the remainder of the study, we
describe the \citetalias{cantatgaudin_gaia_2018} members as the
``core'' of the cluster, and any non-overlapping
\citetalias{kounkel_untangling_2019} and \citetalias{meingast_2021}
members as the ``halo''.  This defintion implies that there are
\ncore\ core members, and \nhalo\ halo members.  The distinction is
tautological, in the sense that \citetalias{cantatgaudin_gaia_2018} did
not extend their search for members out to tens of degrees from the
cluster center.  Nonetheless, the \citetalias{cantatgaudin_gaia_2018}
membership catalog is consistent with that of many earlier
investigators \citep[{\it
e.g.},][]{jeffries_ngc2516_2001,Kharchenko_et_al_2013}, and is
consistent with the general visual overdensity one sees when viewing
\cn\ in the sky: it appears to span $\approx$2$^\circ$, not
$\approx20^\circ$.

Outside of the core and halo, we also define a set of nearby field
stars in the ``neighborhood'' of \cn.  Based on the observed
distribution of halo members, we drew these stars randomly from the
following intervals of right ascension, declination, and parallax:
\begin{align}
  \alpha\,[\mathrm{deg}] &\in [108, 132], \\
  \delta\,[\mathrm{deg}] &\in [-76, -45], \\
  \pi\,[\mathrm{mas}] &\in [1.5, 4.0].
\end{align}
We imposed a magnitude limit of $G=19$\,mag, and ran the queries using
the \texttt{astroquery.gaia} module \citep{astroquery_2018}.  We
allowed the number of stars in the comparison sample to exceed that in
the cluster sample by a factor of $\approx$5, to ensure broad sampling
of stellar masses and evolutionary states.  We also required the
comparison sample to not overlap with the cluster sample.%, which led to
%the omission of 1.1\% of the stars drawn from the volume noted above.

The style of visualization given in Figure~\ref{fig:gaia6d} does not
make it clear, in our eyes, why the clustering algorithms have decided
to associate certain stars with the halo.  Canonically, open clusters
are spherical, and span $\approx$10\,pc \citep[{\it
e.g.},][]{Kharchenko_et_al_2013}.  Inverting the parallaxes in
Figure~\ref{fig:gaia6d} shows that members have been reported from
line-of-sight distances ranging from $\approx$$300$ to
$\approx$$600\,$pc. 
Is this structure real? What explains its existence?


% Are these halo stars truly associated with the cluster's core?
% What is the 
% The opportunity of verifying and understanding the diffuse
% population of \cn\ prompted our interest in understanding
% the reality and origin of the halo.  

%Stars in the upper right quadrant of the $\mu_{\alpha'}$ {\it vs.}
%$\mu_\delta$ projection were reported almost entirely by
%\citet{meingast_2021}.

An initial step in visualizing the reported structure and kinematics
of the candidate cluster members is to consider them in Cartesian
coordinates (Figure~\ref{fig:XYZ}).  We computed the physical
positions by transforming from $(\alpha, \delta, \pi)$ to
galactocentric ($X,Y,Z$) assuming the \texttt{astropy v4.0} coordinate
standard \citep{astropy_2018}.  The direction of galactic rotation is
$+\hat{Y}$. The cluster orbit (gray line) was evaluted by taking the
median parameters for core members for which
\citetalias{cantatgaudin_gaia_2018} reported membership probabilities
exceeding 70\%.  We then integrated the orbit using \texttt{gala} and
the \texttt{MWPotential2014} potential \citep{bovy_galpy_2015,gala}.

The general shape of the cluster itself seems to include a central overdensity
and two tails (the halo).  One tail is leading the cluster's orbit,
and is angled toward the center of the galaxy when viewed top-down.
The other tail is trailing the cluster's orbit, and is pointed away
from the center of the galaxy.  The elongation of the cluster in both
the $(X,Y)$ and $(Z,Y)$ planes is correlated with the direction of the
LSR-corrected median cluster velocity.   Possible explanations for
this overall morphology are discussed in Section~\ref{subsec:origin}.



\section{Age-Dating the Halo of NGC\,2516}
\label{sec:agedate}

\subsection{HR Diagram from Gaia}
\label{subsec:hr}

\begin{figure*}[t]

  \caption{ {\bf HR diagrams of NGC\,2516.}
    {\it Left}: Photometric data from Gaia EDR3; no reddening
    correction has been applied.  The core (black) shows a
    main-sequence and turnoff consistent with stars of a fixed age and
    metallicity.  The halo (blue) is similar, though the binary
    sequence is less defined.  The faintest M dwarfs in the core and
    halo are brighter than field stars (gray) with the same color,
    consistent with the cluster M dwarfs not having yet reached the
    main-sequence.  {\it Right}: PARSEC isochrones ([Fe/H]=+0.06) are
    overplotted at intervals of $\log_{10}(t/\mathrm{yr})=\{8, 8.25,
    8.5\}$.  The arrow represents the average reddening correction
    applied to the models.  The opacity of the M-dwarf model
    atmospheres is less well-calibrated for $M_\star \lesssim
    0.45M_\odot$ ($\approx$M2V; $Bp-Rp\approx$2.2); these model values
    are shown with dashed lines.
    \label{fig:hr}
  }
\end{figure*}

The first check on whether the candidate cluster members
share the same age is to analyze the Gaia Hertzsprung-Russell (HR)
diagrams.  Comparable analyses have previously been performed by
\citetalias{cantatgaudin_gaia_2018},
\citetalias{kounkel_untangling_2019}, and \citetalias{meingast_2021}.

Figure~\ref{fig:hr} shows the HR diagram in the space of absolute Gaia
$G$ magnitude as a function of observed $Bp-Rp$ color.  Stars in
the core appear consistent with
having a fixed age and metallicity, and varying mass.  The halo stars
show a similar sequence, though with greater scatter.  One possible
explanation for the additional scatter could be that the halo is more
contaminated by field stars.  For instance, $\approx5$ red
giants in the halo
must be field interlopers, because their isochronally implied
ages would be inconsistent with that of the cluster.

A second possible explanation for scatter in the halo's HR diagram
could be differential reddening across different sightlines.  The
reported halo spans 20$^\circ$ on-sky, and varies in position from
about $b=-12^\circ$ to $b=-20^\circ$, with the stars closest to the
galactic plane also being further from the Sun by up to 300\,pc
(Figure~\ref{fig:gaia6d}).  Some empirical evidence for differential
reddening is discussed in Appendix~\ref{app:diffred}. Based on the
available evidence, we expect that both field star contamination and
differential reddening could play a role in the larger scatter of the
halo relative to the core.  A third possibility that we have not
explored is whether the binary fraction could also differ between the
different regions of the cluster.

In the right panel of Figure~\ref{fig:hr}, we compare the observed
Gaia EDR3 photometry with PARSEC isochrones
\citep{bressan_parsec_2012,chen_improving_2014,chen_parsec_2015,marigo_new_2017}.
We used the web
interface\footnote{\url{http://stev.oapd.inaf.it/cgi-bin/cmd},
\texttt{2021-02-26}, \texttt{CMD3.4}, \texttt{YBC} bolometric
corrections as in \citet{chen_2019_YBC}.} to interpolate these
isochrones at $\log_{10}(t/\mathrm{yr})=\{8, 8.25, 8.5\}$.

To determine the reddening correction across \cn, we
queried the 2MASS
DUST
service\footnote{
	\url{http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/DUST};
	query performed using the \texttt{astrobase.services.dust} module
	\citep{bhatti_astrobase_2018}.
}
and retrieved the extinction parameters at the positions of each
NGC\,2516 member.  The mean and standard
deviation of the $E(B-V)$ values for the \citet{schlegel_maps_1998}
and \citet{schlafly_measuring_2011} maps were consistent, so we
adopted the average from \citet{schlegel_maps_1998}: $E(B-V)_{\rm
S}=0.206\pm0.039$.  \citet{bonifacio_search_2000} found however that
the \citet{schlegel_maps_1998} maps overestimate the reddening values
when the color excess exceeds about 0.10\,mag. Applying the correction
proposed by \citet{bonifacio_search_2000} leads to our adopted
$E(B-V)=0.102\pm0.019$.  Finally, to convert to Gaia colors we used
the calibration of \citet{stassun_TIC8_2019}, namely $E(Bp-Rp)=1.31
E(B-V)$ and $A_G=2.72 E(B-V)$.  This yielded $E(Bp-Rp)=0.134\pm0.025$,
which is used in the plots.  To redden the isochrones, we assumed
$R_V=3.1$, and applied the \citet{odonnell_1994} SED-dependent
extinction law star-by-star through the PARSEC interface. 

For the metallicity, we considered a range of super and sub-solar
metallicities to fit as much of the locus from $0.5<Bp-Rp<1.5$ as
possible, and settled on the slightly super-solar $[M/H]=0.06$
\citep{cummings_2011_li_iron}.  Sub-solar metallicities led to model
predictions too blue along the main sequence by $\approx$0.1\,mag.
Our adopted metallicity agrees with the spectroscopic metallicity from
\citet[][Sec~4.4.4]{cummings_2011_li_iron}, and with the iron
abundance recently determined by the Gaia-ESO team
\citep{baratella_gaiaeso_2020}, which represented an up-revision from
an earlier sub-solar metallicity \citep{randich_gaiaeso_2018}.  While
\citet{bailey_rv_2018} report a slightly sub-solar metallicity for the
cluster, we prefer super-solar based on the goodness of fit from the
photometry.

Overall, the data and models agree for masses above
$\approx$0.45\,$M_\odot$.  Below this mass, the data and models diverge at
colors redder than $Bp-Rp\approx2.2$, in the sense that the model
isochrones have lower luminosities and bluer colors than the
observations.\footnote{The 100 Myr isochrone does overlap well with the
lower main sequence, but it fails to fit the upper main sequence and
red giants.}  The MIST isochrones showed a comparable disagreement
\citep{choi_mesa_2016}.  Proposed explanations for the discrepancy
between the models and observations have include starspots and
incomplete molecular line lists\citep[{\it
e.g.},][]{stauffer_why_2003,feiden_magnetic_2013,rajpurohit_effective_2013,mann_spectrothermometry_2013,choi_mesa_2016}.
Ultimately, we adopted the PARSEC isochrones because
\citet{chen_improving_2014} implemented an empirical
temperature-opacity calibration, which leads the PARSEC isochrones to
diverge at slightly lower mass than the MIST models.  Regardless, for
purposes of age-dating the cluster we focus on the main-sequence
turn-off (MSTO), since this is where the models have maximal
predictive power.

\citet{cummings_2018} presented techniques for mitigating some of the
complexities of MSTO age-dating ({\it e.g.}, sparse turnoffs, stellar
rotation, high binarity fractions, and the presence of blue
stragglers).  Combining a $UBV$ color-color analysis with Gaia DR2
cluster memberships, they found MSTO ages for NGC\,2516 ranging from
165 to 195\,Myr, depending on the choice of model isochrone (Y$^2$,
PARSEC, MIST, or SYCLIST).  %Their statistical uncertainties ($\approx
%25$\,Myr) were comparable to the systematic uncertainties.

Our goal is to determine whether the ages of the core and halo
are consistent.  The left panel of Figure~\ref{fig:hr} suggests that
isochronally, they are: stars past the turnoff in both the halo and
core are on a consistent locus.  The right panel of
Figure~\ref{fig:hr} demonstrates the precision with which the claim
can be made.  The MSTO stars are consistent with the 178 and 316 Myr
models, but are bluer than the 100 Myr model.  The red-giant-branch (RGB) stars are
consistent only with the 178 Myr ($\log_{10} t/{\rm yr} = 8.25$)
model.  Based on the assumption that the width of the MSTO can be
attributed to binary stars, we are most interested in the blue edge
(blue stragglers are, however, a concern).  The blue edge appears most
compatible with the 178 Myr model.  These results are consistent with
the MSTO age range of 165 to 195\,Myr found by \citet{cummings_2018},
and we refer to their work for the more precise model-dependent
comparison.  Based on Table~3 of \citet{cummings_2018}, we therefore
adopt a PARSEC-based isochrone age for \cn\ of $165\pm35$\,Myr, where
our quoted uncertainty is a quadrature sum of the statistical
and systematic components from \cite{cummings_2018}. 
%The relative age of ``slightly older than
%the Pleiades'' is likely the more robust statement, consistent with
%reports since \citet{mermilliod_comparative_1981}.

    $\mathcal{A}$ ({\it left}) and $\mathcal{B}$ ({\it right}) undergo successive stages of automated cleaning,
    (see Section~\ref{subsubsec:cluster}).  The Pleiades

    cluster isochrone (photometric binaries; 20\% of stars).
		\label{fig:rot}
	}
\end{figure*}

We began our rotation analysis by considering all \nkinematic\
candidate members of \cn.  For each source, we retrieved all available
CDIPS light curves, on a per-sector basis.  This yielded \ncdips\
stars with at least one sector from a CDIPS light curve.  Each of
these stars is brighter than the CDIPS magnitude limit of
$Rp=16$\,mag.  \nkinematicrpltsixteen\ of the stars from the \cn\
source list had $Rp<16$.  The difference (65 stars)
is due to 35 stars from 
\citet{meingast_2021} which were not available at the time of the
CDIPS reductions, and 30 stars falling on the TESS chip gaps.  The
$Rp=16$\,mag cutoff imposed during the CDIPS processing corresponds
roughly to $(Bp-Rp)_0$ of 2.2, or a spectral type of $\approx$M2V, at
the distance of \cn.

We removed systematic trends shared between all light curves on each
CCD in each sector individually, and stitched together the resulting
light curves before searching for rotation-induced periodicity.
Details regarding our detrending approach are presented in
Appendix~\ref{app:detrending}.  After applying the initial
ensemble decorrelation to remove systematic trends, we proceeded with a few
cleaning steps: we masked 0.7 days at the beginning and end of each
spacecraft orbit, and ran a sliding standard-deviation rejection
window over the light curve, which removed any outlying points within
$\pm3\times$MAD of the median in each window.

We then measured the rotation period from the resulting light curve
using the periodogram implementations in \texttt{astrobase}, namely
the traditional Lomb-Scargle, and
the Stellingwerf phase-dispersion minimization algorithm
\citep{lomb_1976,stellingwerf_period_1978,scargle_studies_1982,stellingwerf_period_2011,bhatti_astrobase_2018}.
We used the CDIPS aperture radius that, based on theoretical
expectations, was expected to give the optimal balance between light
from the target star and background-light \citep{Sullivan_2015}.  This
typically resulted in an aperture radius of either 1 or 1.5 pixels.
We recorded the top five periodogram peaks from each method, and their
corresponding powers.  Finally, as a check on crowding, we recorded
the number of stars within the aperture with equal or greater
brightness than the target star, and with brightness within 1.25 and
2.5 TESS magnitudes of the target star.

To clean the resulting rotation period measurements, we designed a set
of automated cleaning criteria, which yielded sets we denote
$\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$.  For both sets, we considered
light curves for which the peak Lomb-Scargle periodogram period was
below 15 days, the normalized Lomb-Scargle power exceeded 0.08, and
for which no equal-brightness or greater companions were within the
aperture.  Beyond requiring that the target star be the brightest star
in the aperture, we also required that at most one companion with
brightness exceeding one tenth of the target star's brightness be
present in the aperture according to the Gaia DR2 source catalog.  For
set $\mathcal{A}$, this yielded \nautorotnumerator\ light curves, out
of \nautorotdenominator\ stars for which rotation periods might
plausibly have been detected.  For set $\mathcal{B}$, we additionally
required that the Lomb-Scargle and Stellingwerf phase-dispersion
methods yielded identical periods to within 10\%.  This yielded
\nautorotnumeratormatching\ light curves. 

The top row of Figure~\ref{fig:rot} shows the resulting rotation
periods, with set $\mathcal{A}$ shown the left and $\mathcal{B}$ on
the right.  While set $\mathcal{A}$ is more complete than set
$\mathcal{B}$, this completeness comes at the expense of greater
contamination.  For instance, stars above the slow sequence (perhaps
field contaminants) mostly disappear in set $\mathcal{B}$.
The ``void'' or ``gap'' underneath the slow sequence is also more
pronounced in set $\mathcal{B}$.  To facilitate a comparison against
the Pleiades and Praesepe, we used the rotation periods and dereddened
colors from Table~5 of \citet{curtis_rup147_2020}, which drew on data
from \citet{rebull_rotation_2016a} and \citet{douglas_k2_2019}
respectively.  The first order conclusion is that the Pleiades and
\cn\ appear gyrochronologically coeval for colors spanning
$0.5<(Bp-Rp)_0<1.2$.  The implications of this comparison for the age
of \cn\ are discussed in Section~\ref{disc:absage}.
%An important note is that stars redder than $(Bp-Rp)_0\gtrsim 2.2$
%(later than $\approx$M2V)  are beyond the magnitude limit of our survey.

The bottom row of Figure~\ref{fig:rot} shows the same data, with the
points colored with indicators of binarity.  To assess astrometric
binarity, we used the renormalized unit weight error (RUWE) from Gaia
EDR3.  For plotting purposes, we labeled anything with RUWE exceeding
1.2 as an astrometric binary (11\% of the overall cluster sample; see
{\it e.g.}, \citealt{belokurov_unresolved_2020}).  To assess
photometric binarity, we fitted a spline to Figure~\ref{fig:hr} and fixed
the nodes by hand.  We then labeled any points brighter than 0.3\,mag above the cluster
sequence as photometric binaries.  This included 20\% of the overall
cluster sample.  Many of the resulting candidate binaries, though not
all of them, appear below the slow rotation sequence.  In set
$\mathcal{B}$, over the color range where the slow and fast sequence
are present ($0.5<(Bp-Rp)_0<1.3$), there are 281 stars, of which 103
(37\%) show signs of binarity.  Dividing these 281 stars into ``fast''
and ``slow'' sequences by eye,  the fraction of stars showing signs of
binarity in the slow and fast subsamples are 30\% (63/210)
and 56\% (40/71), respectively.  We speculate on possible explanations
in Section~\ref{disc:rotn}.

\end{figure*}

Given the rotation periods from TESS, we can explore how far away from
the core we observe cluster members from the core in position and
velocity space.  To do this, we cross-matched the stars with detected
rotation periods against our original target list of \nkinematic\ Gaia
DR2 kinematic candidate members.  For a fair comparison, we considered
only the stars with $0.5<(Bp-Rp)_0<1.2$ for which our TESS pipeline
successfully made detrended light curves.  In other words---the base
sample is the stars for which we could have plausibly detected a
rotation period.  Faint stars with $Rp>16$ were beyond our light curve
selection limit, and stars not meeting the crowding requirements
previously described are omitted.  We selected the color range above
based on Figure~\ref{fig:rot}, since the density of period detections
seems to decrease once $(Bp-Rp)_0 \gtrsim 1.25$, {\it i.e.}, for
spectral types later than $\approx$K4V.

The results are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:physical_x_rotn}.
Appendix~\ref{app:gaia6d_x_rotn} includes a supplemental visualization
in the observed space of Gaia measurements, rather than Cartesian
coordinates and tangential velocities.  The observed proper motions
however suffer from projection effects, discussed in
Appendix~\ref{app:vproj} {\bf TODO: merge these appendices}.  These
effects are important in the equatorial coordinate system due to the
proximity of some \cn\ members to the southern ecliptic pole.  For a
star at position $(\alpha, \delta)$, we correct for the projection
effect by comparing the observed proper motion $(\mu_{\alpha'},
\mu_\delta)$ to what the proper motion at the star's position would
have been if the star were comoving with the core of \cn.  This yields
a quantity we denote $\Delta \mu^{*}$, following
\citetalias{meingast_2021}.  We then convert these proper motion
differences to physical units by dividing by the distance to each
star, taken as the inverse parallax.  

{\bf FIXME FIXME FIXME} 
The results suggest that the
fraction of kinematic members with TESS-detected rotation periods may
decrease with increasing distance from the halo core---both in
position and in velocity space.  

%The inverse parallax approximation does not introduce significant
%biases for this sample, since the mean $\pi/\sigma_\pi$ and its
%standard deviation are 122 and 40 respectively; the minimum is 19.5.

We quantified this by computing the separation of the positions and 2D
velocities from the median \citetalias{cantatgaudin_gaia_2018} core
member {\bf TODO: clarify binning choice}.  The result is shown on the right side of
Figure~\ref{fig:physical_x_rotn}.  The halo extends to separations of
about 200\,pc in physical space from the cluster core.  The most
widely separated F2V-K2V stars with rotation periods (blue points in
Figure~\ref{fig:physical_x_rotn}) are separated by $\approx$430\,pc.
The total length of the structure is therefore 400--500\,pc, depending
on which members of the halo are chosen as the ``tips'' on either end.
Broadly speaking, this agrees with the structure of the halo reported
by \citetalias{kounkel_untangling_2019}.

{\bf FIXME update this text, make it less crappy... ditto the figure}
In projection-corrected tangential velocity space, the fraction of
stars with rotation period detections remains high out to roughly
5\kms.  \citet{meingast_2021} by comparison required a physically
motivated cut in tangential velocity space of 1.5\kms.  Our results
show that at the expense of higher field star contamination rates,
bonafide members can be identified even out to higher velocity
separations.  {\bf todo: anything else to mention? e.g., the actual
numbers?}

\end{figure*}

The third and final approach we took for confirming the youth of the
halo population of \cn\ was an analysis of the Li\,\textsc{I}
6708\,\AA\ doublet.  The method has been reviewed by
\citet{soderblom_ages_2010}, and its connection to stellar rotation
has recently been surveyed by \citet{bouvier_lithium-rotation_2020}.
For \cn, two spectroscopic datasets seemed particularly important:
Gaia-ESO \citep{gilmore_gaiaeso_2012} and GALAH
\citep{silva_galah_2015}.  At the time of analysis, Gaia-ESO DR4 and
GALAH DR3 were the most relevant, respectively \citep[{\it
e.g.},][]{randich_gaiaeso_2018,buder_galah_2020}.  The target
selection and results from each survey were as follows.

Gaia-ESO selected candidate \cn\ members to observe with the GIRAFFE
and UVES spectrographs based on previously reported literature members
and publicly available photometry.  Since the existence of the \cn\
halo was not known at the time of target selection, very few ``halo''
stars are in the sample.  For \cn, \citet{randich_gaiaeso_2018}
ultimately reported stellar parameters (including lithium equivalent
widths and metallicities) for 796 stars that they considered possible
\cn\ members.  Cross-matching against our kinematic list of
\nkinematic\ candidate members by position and imposing a 0$\farcs$5
maximum separation limit yields 492 kinematic members for which a
Gaia-ESO spectrum was acquired and stellar parameters were reported.
15 of these (all with $(Bp-Rp)_0 > 2.0$) are spurious matches based on
the Gaia color and GES effective temperature, and we remove them.
This yields 477 stars, of which 436 are in the core, and 41 are in the
halo.  The lop-sided ratio is due to the Gaia-ESO selection function.
We verified by directly querying the ESO archive that
\citet{randich_gaiaeso_2018} indeed included $>99\%$ of the available
Gaia-ESO spectra as part of their \cn\ sample, and so we opted to use
their results rather than repeating their analysis.

The GALAH DR3 target selection is discussed in depth by
\citet{buder_galah_2020}.  The relevant aspects for our analysis are
that the ``main'' survey targeted $12<V<14$ stars at
$\delta<+10^\circ$, provided the stars were at least ten degrees from
the galactic plane.  The survey is spatially
inhomogeneous\footnote{See the footprint at
\url{https://www.galah-survey.org/news/announcing-galah-dr3}}. Special
targeting for stars in the TESS southern continuous viewing zone, and
for known open cluster members was also performed.  We identified the
candidate \cn\ members for which spectra had been obtained by
searching the \texttt{GALAH\_DR3\_main\_allstar\_v1} catalog, after
excluding stars with the stellar parameter bit flags 1, 2, 3.  This
excludes spectra with unreliable broadening, low S/N, and unreliable
wavelength solutions (see Table~6 of \citealt{buder_galah_2020}).
Since our main focus is measuring equivalent widths for the
Li\,6708\,\AA\ doublet, these were the most relevant bit flags.  Of our
\nkinematic\ candidate \cn\ members, 107 had spectra in GALAH DR3.  51
were in the ``core''; 56 were in the ``halo''.  78 had ``finite''
lithium, i.e., no lithium flag set.

We downloaded\footnote{Via \url{datacentral.org.au/services/download},
using the \texttt{sobject\_id} identifiers.} the GALAH DR3 spectra for
all 107 entries.  We then measured the lithium equivalent widths using
the \texttt{specutils} package \citep{specutils_v1pt1}.  We did this
by first focusing in on a 15\AA\ window centered on the 6707.835\AA
lithium doublet.  We then continuum normalized the spectra using a
third-degree Chebyshev series, while excluding any regions that showed
absorption lines ({\it e.g.}, Fe\,\textsc{I} is present at
6703.58\,\AA and 6705.10\,\AA).  We proceeding by fitting a Gaussian
to the continuum normalized spectra, considering only a $\pm 1\,$\AA
window centered on the Li doublet.  The equivalent widths were then
evaluated by numerically integrating the fitted model over the same
window.  Our approach therefore includes the Fe\,6707.44 blend in the
reported Li equivalent widths---which leads to systematic
overestimates of $\approx$10 to 15\,m\AA\ \citep[{\it
e.g.},][]{bouvier_pleiades_lirot_2018}.  Finally, to derive
uncertainties on the EWs, we repeated the procedure twenty times, but
added noise to the spectra, drawn from a normal distribution with a
scale set by the standard deviation of the continuum.  The reported
uncertainties are then drawn from the $84^{\rm th}$ and $16^{\rm th}$
percentiles of the resulting EW distribution.  We verified the overall
scale of our results by comparing the 21 stars that overlapped between
GALAH and Gaia-ESO.  17 of the 21 measurements agreed within
1-$\sigma$.  The remaining four were stars with $T_{\rm
eff}>6200\,{\rm K}$, for which \citet{randich_gaiaeso_2018} reported
Li EW detections ranging from $50$ to $75\,$m\AA, and for which we
found either null results or only slightly significant
($\approx$30m\AA) detections.

Figure~\ref{fig:lithiumcorehalo} shows the concatenation of the
Gaia-ESO and GALAH results, with the points colored by whether the
stars are in the core or the halo of the cluster.  The GALAH spectra
span a color range of $0<(Bp-Rp)_0<1.5$, due to the $V<14$ brightness
cutoff of the survey.  The overall increase of Li EW from
$0<(Bp-Rp)_0<1.0$ is thought to be driven by the temperatures in the
stellar chromospheres: hotter stars fully ionize Li out of its ground
state \citep[{\it e.g.}, Figure~4 of][]{soderblom_evolution_1993}.  The
depletion of stars redder than $(Bp-Rp)_0\gtrsim1.4$, {\it i.e.},
later than K4.5V (0.71\,$M_\odot$), is visible relative to the earlier
K dwarfs.  For comparison, we have also plotted the Li EWs measured by
\citet{berger_identifying_2018} for planet-hosting stars in the Kepler
field (we interpolated from their effective temperatures using the
\citet{pecaut_mamajek_2013}
table\footnote{\url{http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~emamajek/EEM_dwarf_UBVIJHK_colors_Teff.txt},
version 2019.3.22.}.  The field star distribution peaks at late F-type
stars.  The majority of kinematically selected stars in the core and
the halo show lithium equivalent widths substantially in excess of
these field stars.

We can go one step further, and match our sample of kinematically
selected stars with spectra against the TESS rotators.  The result is
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:lithiumrot}. At fixed stellar mass, the rapid
rotators have lithium equivalent widths an order of magnitude larger
than the slow rotators.  This effect is mostly apparent in the K
dwarfs.  Similar trends were noted in the Pleiades over three decades
ago \citep{butler_pleiades_1987}, and are most likely caused by
intrinsic differences in lithium abundance
\citep{soderblom_evolution_1993}.  Alternative explanations, such as
differences in line-formation conditions ({\it e.g.,} chromospheric
temperatures, microturbulent velocities, or the presence of starspots)
are incompatible with the available data.  The lithium-rotation
correlation is discussed further below
(Section~\ref{discussion:lithium}).

% Should we be calling the halo a tail?

The halo, comprised of a leading and trailing tail, extends 
over at least 500\,pc.  Are these structures in fact tidal tails?  The
canonical idea behind such a structure \citep[{\it e.g.},][]{krumholz_star_2019} is that
stars escape out of the Lagrange points imposed by the Milky Way's
potential, and then form leading and lagging arms due to differential
rotation in the galaxy.  The leading and lagging arms of \cn\ 
qualitatively match this picture, in that they are oriented
roughly toward and away from the direction of galactic rotation.

A second possible explanation invokes the idea that the cluster formed
in a larger and more dispersed star formation complex, and that the
stars currently in the halo need not have formed in the same ``clump''
as those in the cluster core.  In other words, the formation
environment might be better described a giant molecular filament,
rather than a giant molecular cloud.  A sample of such filaments has
recently been collected and analyzed by \citet{zucker_physical_2018}:
given the current $\approx$20:1 aspect ratio of \cn, its structure
would match the aspect ratios of what they term either ``elongated
dense core complexes'', or ``bone candidates''.  A more immediate
example could be the Orion\,A cloud.  \citet{grosschedl_3d_2018}
showed using YSOs as tracers that Orion\,A is well-described as a
90\,pc long filament with a dense ``head'', and a lower density 75\,pc
long ``tail''. Whether the future evolutionary state of this filament,
or those in the \citet{zucker_physical_2018} sample, could resemble
something like \cn\ is a topic worthy of future numerical exploration.

%The general shape of the cluster itself seems to include a central
%overdensity and two tails (the halo).  One tail is leading the
%cluster's orbit, and is angled toward the center of the galaxy when
%viewed top-down.  The other tail is trailing the cluster's orbit, and
%is pointed away from the center of the galaxy.  The elongation of the
%cluster in both the $(X,Y)$ and $(Z,Y)$ planes is correlated with the
%direction of the LSR-corrected median cluster velocity.   Possible
%explanations for this overall morphology are discussed in
%Section~\ref{subsec:origin}.

TODO: quiver map velocities?

Differential rotation in the galaxy is clearly important. Meingast+21
established this; in ten different cluster halos, nine showed leading
and trailing arms oriented in line with the differential rotation of
the Galaxy.  (See e.g., their Figure 13).

{\it Correlation between mean cluster velocity and elongation axes}
Figure~\ref{fig:XYZ} shows that after subtracting the local standard
of rest, the axes along which \cn\ is elongated are correlated with
its average stellar velocity.
A similar correlation was noted in Coma Ber by
\citet{tang_comaber_2019}. 

CITE ALSO: WRIGHT+2016, WRIGHT AND MAMAJEK 2018 -- LOOKED AT SCO CEN, FOUND
THAT THEY DIDN'T COME FROM A SINGLE CLUSTER BEING DISRUPTED, BUT WERE MORE
LIKELY EXPLAINED THROUGH ``EXTENDED'' STAR FORMATION OVER A MUCH LARGER VOLUME.

Similarly Zari et al 2019 studied the entire Orion complex, and found that
different regions of the complex (one toward the Belt, one toward 25\,Ori)
began forming stars roughly simultaneously. No evidence was found of it
propagating from these initial sites.

\subsection{Rotation at 100-200\,Myr}
\label{disc:rotn}

From their rotation period analysis of \cn,
\citet{fritzewski_rotation_2020} have recently
demonstrated that at ages between 100 and 200\,Myr, young open
clusters ({\cn, Blanco\,1, the Pleiades, Psc\,Eri, M\,35, and M\,50) all
show similar rotation period distributions.  The FGK stars
show a ``slow sequence'', a population of ``rapid rotators'', and
in some cases stars in the ``void'' between the two
populations ({\it e.g.,}, Psc\,Eri and \cn\ show more stars in the void
than the Pleiades).
The late M dwarfs with detected rotation periods tend to rotate very
rapidly ($<3$\,days) --- these are beyond the magnitude
limit of the present analysis.  This section briefly discusses
the origins of these feature.

The existence of a slow sequence is the main premise of gyrochronology
\citep[{\it e.g.},][]{barnes_rotational_2003}.  While the initial
spindown relation ($P_{\rm rot}\sim t^{1/2}$) proposed by
\citet{skumanich_time_1972} has not worked in detail, the 
general idea is correct, and the first-order effect can be understood through magnetic
breaking \citep{weber_angular_1967}.
%More systematic efforts at age-dating stars through their rotation periods.

The other features of the rotation-color diagram are in some sense
affronts to the magnetic breaking model, and the general question of
what produces the rapid rotators has not yet been definitively
answered.  Models that introduce variable core-envelope decoupling
timescales can reproduce each type of population
\citep{Irwin_NGC2516_2007}, but the question then shifts to why these
decoupling timescales should be differ for stars that are otherwise
identical.  Another possible explanation invokes a spontaneous and
random change of magnetic field topology that causes the dynamo to
couple more strongly with the stellar wind
\citep{brown_metastable_2014}.  Other processes could be external the
star entirely: \citet{qureshi_signature_2018} for instance have
reported that mergers between giant planets and the star could explain
a non-neglible fraction of the rapid rotators.

A separate hypothesis that we can test using the existing data is the
idea that rapid rotation can be explained through binarity.  Analyses
by {\it e.g.}, \citet{gillen_ngts_2020} and
\citet{simonian_rapid_2019} have reported that rapid
rotation in young clusters and in the field is correlated with
binarity.  Related effects could include tidal synchronization for the
shortest period binaries, or alternatively disk truncation that when
combined with magnetic locking {\bf (CITE)} could produce the rotation
period bimodality.

The lower panels of Figure~\ref{fig:rot} show our attempt at
identifying unresolved binaries in the \cn\ rotation sample.
Binaries resolved by Gaia were already excluded in our initial
definitions of the samples.
In \cn\, we see that
the fraction of stars showing signs of binarity in the slow and fast
rotation subsamples are 30\% (63/210) and 56\% (40/71); the fast
rotators show a preference for binarity.
This correlation is in line with the earlier findings noted above,
though we emphasize many rapid rotators in \cn\ (34\%) have no 
evidence for being binary.

Comparing the explanations of disk-locking against tidal
synchronization, the population statistics do seem to strain the
possibility of tidal synchronization.  A quarter of the \cn\ members
are rapidly rotating.  In comparison, in the field half of Sun-like
stars are binaries, and $\approx$9\% have periods below 100\,days
\citep{raghavan_survey_2010}.  If we assume  that all
binaries with sub-100\,day periods become tidally synchronized, we
can only explain a rapid rotator occurrence rate of
$\approx$5\%.

A separate effect is that on the slow rotation sequence, 
Figure~\ref{fig:rot}} shows that the
binary stars appear to be either preferentially redder, or to have
faster rotation periods than the single stars.  One likely
explanation for this could be that the unresolved binaries have a
component contributing additional red light to the system, skewing
the color measurement of the primary.  Whether any physical
effects could be at play remains a question for future
work.

% \subsubsection{The slowest K dwarfs of NGC\,2516}
% %FIXME need to rewrite this paragraph? (Or maybe not, because it's
% %already in the absolute age section...
% A few conclusions can be drawn by comparing the \cn\ rotation periods
% with those of the Pleiades and Praesepe.  The first is that in both
% stages of cleaning, the core and halo of \cn\ each show
% gyrochronological ``slow sequences''.  These sequences appear to be
% coeval with each other, and at first order appear to overlap
% with the Pleiades sequence.
% 
%   \paragraph{Stalling}
%   Curtis19 found NGC6811 was stalling in the K dwarfs, i.e., Skumanich
%   spindown is not monotonic in time.
%   We're seeing latest K dwarfs spin slowest, earlier FGKs don't show
%   much change.

%   \paragraph{Are the ``very slow rotators'' bonafide members?}
%   Unsure. They are not isotropically distributed around the
%   cluster... so either triggered star formation (CITE, CITE), or they're
%   actually field stars.


\subsection{The lithium-rotation correlation}
\label{discussion:lithium}

The lithium-rotation correlation (Figure~\ref{fig:lithiumrot}) 
has been shown to carry over beyond
just equivalent widths, and to the actual abundance of lithium in the
photosphere, A(Li).
\citet{soderblom_evolution_1993} calculated the relevant LTE curves of
growth for the Li\,6708\,\AA\ doublet, and used them to
convert our measured equivalent widths to abundances.  Non-LTE
corrections affect the abundances by $<0.5\,{\rm dex}$ and do not
siginificantly affect the global relation between Li abundance and
stellar temperature or rotation
\citep{carlsson_1994,lind_departures_2009}.

More recent studies of lithium and rotation since 
\citet{soderblom_evolution_1993} have expanded these results in the
Pleiades, the Psc-Eri stream, and M\,35, among other clusters
\citep{bouvier_pleiades_lirot_2018,arancibia_2020,jeffries_m35_li_2020}.
In \cn\ specifically, \citet{jeffries_rotation_1998} observed a
similar trend that that seen in Figure~\ref{fig:lithiumrot} when
analyzing 24 stars in the core of \cn.  Our concatenation of the
\citet{randich_gaiaeso_2018} Gaia-ESO results with the GALAH-DR3
spectra represent a significant expanasion in volume and color range
since these earlier studies.

% The fact that we see the same trend across the core and halo of \cn\ 
% {\it a)} supports the interpretation that the halo is coeval with the
% core, and {\it b)} suggests that the lithium-rotation correlation is
% not explained by environmental effects such as the density of the cluster
% during its embedded phase, but is instead tied to physical processes
% acting on all low-mass pre-main-sequence stars.

What causes the correlation between lithium abundance and rotation at
fixed stellar mass?
{\bf FIXME: improve this paragraph}
%FIXME IMPROVE THIS PARAGRAPH.
Processes both internal and external to the star have been suggested to explain
the lithium-rotation trend (CITE see the recent review by Bouvier+20).
One explanation based in the stellar interior could be that the
convective mixing efficiency is anticorrelated with the surface
rotation (e.g., CITE Siess + Livio 1997, Baraffe+2017).  Another
possibility could be that stronger magnetic fields in the star's
interior inhibit convection (READ e.g., Ventura+98, Chabrier+07,
Somers + Pinsonneault 2014).  An external process that might also be
important is the effect of star-disk magnetic locking during the PMS
phase (CITE: magnetic braking).  Longer disk lifetimes would lead to
the star's outer convective zone being locked for longer while the
radiative core contracts.  The resulting differential rotation and
rotational mixing could drive the lithium depletion (CITE: Bouvier 08,
Eggenberger+12).
We have no preference between these possibilities---we simply note
that the \cn\ sample could be another helpful data point in
distinguishing them.


\subsection{Age of NGC\,2516}
\label{disc:absage}

Cummings \& Kalirai (2018) favor 150 Myr based on MSTO.
Godoy-Rivera+2021 favor 150 Myr... based on ...? what?
"""
Similar to Cummings et al. (2016), Cummings \& Kalirai (2018),
and Cummings et al. (2018) (see also Fritzewski et al. 2020 and Healy
\&
McCullough 2020)
"""

\paragraph{Gyrochronological Age}
Comparing the slow sequence of the Pleiades and \cn\ more closely, the
top row of Figure~\ref{fig:rot} shows that the two sequences overlap
from $0.5<(Bp-Rp)_0<1.2$.  At redder colors
($1.2<(Bp-Rp)_0<1.7$) the dispersion in rotation periods increases.
The maximum rotation periods seen in \cn\ across both sets
$\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ extend up to $\approx$11 days, rather
than the $\approx$8.5day upper limit seen in the Pleiades.  This is
consistent with \cn\ being slightly older than the Pleiades.

Fitting a model to substantiate the claim that \cn\ is
gyrochronologically older than the Pleiades \citep[{\it e.g.}, any
of][]{mamajek_improved_2008,angus_toward_2019,spada_competing_2020}
is, unfortunately, an exercise in tautology.  The aforementioned
models are empirically calibrated using the Pleiades and Praesepe.  In
other words, at $(Bp-Rp)_0=1.35$, we observe rotation periods in \cn\
ranging from 7 to 10 days.  The 7 day rotation periods are consistent
with those observed in the Pleiades; the 10 day rotation periods are
not.  Fitting formulae from the previously cited studies give ages for
a star with $\{(Bp-Rp)_0=1.35, (B-V)_0=1.10, P=7\,{\rm day}\}$ of 204
Myr, 316 Myr, and 107 Myr respectively.  Therefore, only the
\citet{spada_competing_2020} model has an absolute scale that is
well-calibrated at these ages and colors.  For an 8 day rotation
period of a star with the same color, this model quotes a 193 Myr age;
at 9 days, 388 Myr.  Given this degree of model uncertainty, we prefer
the relative statement that \cn\ appears slightly gyrochronologically
older than the Pleaides, and much younger than Praesepe.  Given a
Pleiades age of $130\pm15$\,Myr (an average of MSTO and
rotation-corrected lithium-depletion results;
\citealt{cummings_2018}), a gyrochronology-derived age estimate for \cn\
between 150 and 200\,Myr would therefore appear reasonable.  Much
older, and the issue of why the F and G dwarfs do not spin down
becomes pressing.




\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The combination of astrometry from Gaia, photometry from TESS, and
spectroscopy from GALAH and Gaia-ESO has clarified a few things about
the structure of \cn.
\begin{itemize}
  %
  \item {\it Over-densities observed in the Gaia 3-D positions and 2-D
    velocities revealed a halo of stars spanning $\approx$500 parsecs
    in the plane of the galaxy.} The earliest reference to this halo
    that we can find is by \citet{kounkel_untangling_2019}.  The halo
    is more precisely described as a leading and trailing tail
    (Figure~\ref{fig:XYZ}), with the leading edge angled toward the
    galactic center, relative to the cluster's orbit in the Galaxy.
    This is consistent with the direction and amplitude of the Milky
    Way's differential rotation
    ($\approx$-0.2\,deg\,Myr$^{-1}$\,kpc$^{-1}$), and similar
    halos/tails have been observed around $\approx$10 other nearby
    open clusters \citep{meingast_2021}.
	%
  \item {\it Isochronal, rotational, and lithium age-dating show that
    the halo of \cn\ is coeval with its core.} In short, all
    the data are consistent with the halo being real.  The Gaia EDR3
    photometry and astrometry show a main-sequence turnoff that suggest
    an isochronal age of 150\,Myr for both the core and halo
    (Figure~\ref{fig:hr}).  The faintest M dwarfs in the core and halo
    are also brighter than comparison field stars of the same color.
    Gyrochronally, stars in \cn\ spanning $0.5<(Bp-Rp)_0<1.2$
    (spectral types F2V-K3V) overlap with the slow sequence of the
    Pleaides (Figure~\ref{fig:rot}).  At redder
    colors, from $1.2<(Bp-Rp)_0<1.7$ (spectral types K3V-K6V,
    $M_\star$$\approx$ 0.6-0.7\,$M_\odot$), there is a larger
    dispersion in rotation period.  The upper envelope of the rotation
    period distribution at these redder colors extends to
    longer rotation periods than in the Pleiades (11 {\it
    vs.}\ 8 day rotation periods).
    This is consistent with \cn\ being slightly older than the Pleiades
    ({\it i.e.}, $\approx$150\,Myr).
    The lithium equivalent widths of the kinematic cluster members (Figure~\ref{fig:lithiumcorehalo})
    are consistent with this assessment.
  %
  \item {\it Bonafide \cn\ members exist out to $\approx$250\,pc in
    separation and out to $\approx$5\kms\ in
    tangential velocity separation from the cluster core.} Figure~\ref{fig:physical_x_rotn} shows the
    overlap between kinematic and rotational cluster members used to
    make this assessment.
  %
  \item {\it The field star contamination rate increases at larger
    physical and velocity separations from the cluster core.} The
    right panel of Figure~\ref{fig:physical_x_rotn} quantifies the
    statement: $\approx$75\% of the ``inner-most'' members show
    rotation periods consistent with the age of the cluster.  This
    fraction decreases to $\approx$60\% at physical separations of
    $\approx$200\,pc.  Given the number density ratios of cluster to
    field stars at these wide separations ($\approx 10^{-3}$,
    \citealt{meingast_2021}), the implied contamination fractions are
    not as bad as one might fear.
   %
   \item {\it The rapid rotators show elevated lithium abundances, and elevated
   binarity fractions}.
   Each trend has been noted in comparable stellar populations ({\it e.g.,} \citealt{soderblom_evolution_1993}, \citealt{gillen_ngts_2020}).
   The rough orders of magnitude of the effects are $\approx$1\,dex in lithium abundance 
   for a factor of 10 in rotation period, and a factor of $\approx2\times$ enhancement
   in binarity fraction for fast {\it vs.} slowly rotating G and early K dwarfs.
\end{itemize}

Generally speaking, the existence of the halo itself should not be not very
surprising.  A star with a 1\kms\ velocity difference from the cluster
average will move away from the center at a rate of 1\,pc\,Myr$^{-1}$.
For a $\sim$100\,Myr old cluster, a halo with characteristic size
$\sim$100\,pc is therefore expected, given that the typical velocity
dispersions of open clusters are of the order of kilometers per
second.

On the other hand, our ability to reliably identify members of these
halos is rather surprising.  These stars have
remained hidden in the background of the Galaxy throughout centuries
of modern astronomy.  The consequences that these halo stars will have
in expanding our understanding of planetary and stellar origins are
only just beginning to be understood.

Figure~\ref{fig:venn} is a Venn diagram showing the overlap between
the three membership catalogs concatenated in this study.  99\% of the
\citetalias{cantatgaudin_gaia_2018} sample overlaps with
\citetalias{kounkel_untangling_2019}, \citetalias{meingast_2021}, or
both.  By comparison, 36\% of the \citetalias{kounkel_untangling_2019}
sample, and 15\% of the \citetalias{meingast_2021} sample are
non-overlapping.
The data---Gaia DR2---used by all the studies was the same.
What are the differences in methodology that produce these different
outcomes?

% TODO: the following two paragraphs, WHEN QUOTED, are ENTIRELY FROM
% the relevant papers. they should probably be nixed in favor of
% concision.
%
\citetalias{cantatgaudin_gaia_2018} applied a procedure that 
yielded what we call ``the core''.  Their procedure was to first query
a Gaia DR2 cone around the previously reported RA and dec of the
cluster, and within $\pm 0.5$\,mas of its previously reported
distance. 
% TODO: which was it?
The outer radius of their cone was either r2 from MWSC (CITE
Kharchenko 2013), or twice the ``cluster radius'' listed by DAML/Dias (CITE).  No
proper motion cut was applied.  They then applied an unsupervised
classification scheme called UPMASK to $G<18$\,mag stars within this
cone (CITE).  The steps of UPMASK are first to perform a k-means
clustering in the ``astrometric space'' ($\mu_{\alpha'}, \mu_\delta,
\pi$).  Then, a ``veto'' step is applied to assess whether the groups
of stars output from the k-means clustering are or are not more
concentrated than a random distribution.  This is implemented by
``comparing the total branch length of the minimum spanning tree
connecting the stars with the expected branch length for a random
uniform distribution covering the investigated field of view''.  ``To
turn this yes/no flag to a membership probability,
\citet{cantatgaudin_gaia_2018} then redraw new values of
($\mu_{\alpha'}, \mu_\delta, \pi$) for each source based on the listed
value, uncertainty, and covariance.  After a certain number of
redrawings, the final probability is the frequency with which a given
star passes the veto".  In the case of \cn, this yielded a reported
``\texttt{r50}'' within which half of the cluster members were found
to be within 0.496$^\circ$.
When we selected candidate \cn\ members from the results of
\citetalias{cantatgaudin_gaia_2018}, we opted to include all candidate members
with reported membership probability exceeding 10\%.
While this seems {\it a priori} low, our results ({\bf SECTION XXX})
show that this ``membership probabilty'' severely underestimates the
purity of the \citetalias{cantatgaudin_gaia_2018} sample for \cn. 
%TODO: quantify
Their false positive rate across the sample is more like 1-5\%.

\citetalias{kounkel_untangling_2019}
applied a different unsupervised
clustering method to the 5-dimensional Gaia DR2 data (omitting radial
velocities, due to their sparsity).  Their selection function (see
their Section~2) yielded $\approx 2\times 10^7$ stars, mostly within
$\approx 1$\,kpc and typically with $G<18$\,mag.  Their clustering
algorithm, which was run on this entire  stellar sample,
 was the ``hierarchical density-based spatial clustering of
applications with noise'' (HDBSCAN, CITE McInnes17).  The classical
DBSCAN algorithm ``identifies clusters as overdensities in a
multi-dimensional space in which the number of sources exceeds the
required minimum number of points within a neighborhood of a
particular linking length $\epsilon$.  HDBSCAN does not depend on
$\epsilon$; instead it condenses the minimum spanning tree by pruning
off the nodes that do not meet the minimum number of sources in a
cluster and reanalyzing the nodes that do. Depending on the chosen
algorithm, it would then either find the most persistent structure
(through the excess of mass method), or return clusters as the leaves
of the tree (which results in somewhat more homogeneous clusters). In
both cases it is more effective at finding structures of varying
densities in a given data set than DBSCAN.''
`` The two main parameters that control HDBSCAN are the number of
sources in a cluster and the number of samples. The former is the
parameter that rejects groupings that are too small; the latter sets
the threshold of how conservative the algorithm is in its
considerations of the background noise (even if the resulting noisy
groupings do meet the minimum cluster size).  By default, the sample
size is set to the same value as the cluster size, but it is possible
to adjust them separately.''
Regarding membership proabilities,
\citetalias{kounkel_untangling_2019} did not report continuous membership
probabilities, instead opting for the binary ``member'' or ``not''.

\citetalias{meingast_2021} did the same as
\citetalias{kounkel_untangling_2019}, but required A) the tangential
velocity dispersions to be smaller, and B) deconvolved the distances.

\section{Detrending details}
\label{app:detrending}

In ``detrending'' for our general variability search, our goal was to
preserve astrophysical variability, while removing systematic
variability.  One particular concern for the TESS light curves is
systematic variability at the timescale of the 14-day satellite orbit,
mostly induced by scattered light from the Earth and Moon.

We therefore turned to the principal components (i.e., the
eigenvectors) calculated following the procedure described by
\citet{bouma_cdipsI_2019}. In brief, these vectors are computed using
a set of ``trend stars'' selected from across each CCD according to
ad-hoc heuristics that (hopefully) lead them to be dominated by {\it
systematic} variability (Sec~3.7.2).

The principal component vectors, also referred to as the eigenvectors,
are rank-ordered by the degree of variance that they predict in the
training set (of ``trend stars'').

We then posit that any given target star's light curve is described as
a linear combination of the eigenvectors.  Optionally, we also
considered the inclusion of additional systematic vectors that could
affect the light curve, such as the CCD temperature, the flux level
measured in the background annulus, and the centroid positions of the
stars on the CCDs.  These can be treated as additional ``features'' in
the linear model.

To determine the coefficients of the linear
model after the full set of eigenvectors (plus optionally
``sytematic'' vectors) had been asssembled,  we explored two possible
methods: ordinary
least squares, and ridge regression. Ridge regression is the same as
ordinary least squares, except it includes an L2 norm with a regularization
coefficient. The regularization coefficient that best applied for any
given target light curve was solved for using a cross-validation grid
search, using \texttt{sklearn.linear\_modelRidgeCV} (CITE). 

Each target light curve was mean-subtracted and normalized by its
standard deviation, as were the eigenvectors. The linear problem was
then solved numerically, and the light curve was reconstructed by re-adding the
original mean, and re-multiplying by the standard deviation to ensure
that the variance of the light curve did not change.

We found that the choice of using ordinary
least squares versus ridge regression did not seem to significantly
affect the resulting light curves. In other words, the inclusion (or
lack thereof) of a regularization term did not strongly alter the
best-fitting coefficients.
In the spirit of ``KISS'', we opted to use ordinary least squares.

A few other choices seemed to be more important:

\begin{itemize}

  \item {\it To smooth, or to not smooth the eigenvectors}.
  Ideally, the eigenvectors should be smooth in time. They should not contain
    residuals from {\it e.g.}, eclipsing binaries that snuck their way
    into the template set, and they should also not be intrinsically noisier
    than the target star. If either of these is the case (and we found that
    it sometimes was), it can
    induce extra variability into the PCA ``detrended'' light curves.
    To address this problem, we opted to smooth the eigenvectors using
    a time-windowed filter (with a "biweight" weight scheme, implemented in
    \texttt{wotan} by \citet{hippke_wotan_2019}; window length 1 day, cval 6).
  One issue with this is that systematic sharp features (captured e.g., in
  "spike vectors") no longer are captured, so they end up in the "PCA
  detrended" light curves. They can then be filtered out
  ({\it e.g.}, using rolling outlier rejection), and we prefer this approach to having
  systematic features being {\it injected by} the PCA detrending.

  \item {\it How many eigenvectors to use}.
    A larger number always leads to greater whitening.  In
    \citet{bouma_cdipsI_2019}, we performed a Factor Analysis
    cross-validation to determine the number of eigenvectors to use.
    The typical number adopted based on this analysis was 10--15.
    While this approach should in theory prevent over-fitting, in
    our experience, for stellar rotation it still often lead to
    distorts the signals, especially for rotation signals with small amplitudes
    and periodicities of
    $\gtrsim 3$ days.  (Shorter signals typically are not distorted,
    since the eigenvectors do not contain the high-frequency
    content that leads to the distortions).  For the present analysis, we
    therefore impose the maximum number of eigenvectors to be 5.

  \item {\it Which supplementary systematics vectors to use}.
    We considered using the \texttt{BGV}, \texttt{CCDTEMP},
    \texttt{XIC}, \texttt{YIC}, and \texttt{BGV} vectors, packaged
    with the CDIPS light curves. We found that the background value
    measured in an annulus centered on the aperture, \texttt{BGV},
    tended to produce the best independent information from the PCA
    eigenvectors, and so we adopted it as our only ``supplementary''
    trend vector.  We opted to not smooth it (in hopes that it would
    provide direct complement to the smoothed PCA vectors; 1 sharp
    vector containing literally the background information, plus 5
    smooth vectors).
\end{itemize}

For every ``target star'', we then decorrelated the raw
(image-subtracted and background-subtracted) light curve
using a linear model with ordinary least squares.

\section{Comparison Star Rotation Periods}
\label{app:compstar}

\begin{figure}[t]

    \includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{f9.pdf}
	\end{center}
	\vspace{-0.7cm}
	\caption{ {\bf Rotation in NGC\,2516 compared to the field.}
  Stars with Gaia $Rp<13$\,mag in the cluster and field samples were
  considered. (Fainter stars in the field sample were not studied as part
  of the broader CDIPS project).
  The field stars show a different rotation period distribution than
  the kinematically selected NGC\,2516 members.
  \label{fig:compstar}
	}
\end{figure}

To provide a basis for comparison, we also opted to search the
``calibration'' light curves ($Rp<13$) that were created as a part of
the CDIPS project.  Over the southern sky (Sectors 1-13 of TESS), this
corresponded to a sample of \ncalibration\ stars.  Cross-matching these
against the \nnbhd\ randomly drawn stars in the neighborhood of \cn yielded
\nnbhdcalibstar\ unique stars, with a cumulative total of
\nnbhdcaliblc\ TESS
sectors observed.
The magnitude cut of $Rp<13$ at the distances of the neighborhood sample
corresponds to an extinction-corrected color cutoff of $(Bp-Rp)_0
\approx 0.80$, or spectral types of $\approx$G1V.
This reaches sufficiently far down the main-sequence to enable a
comparison to the cluster star sample.

We performed the same light curve stitching and period-search
procedure on the field comparison stars.
Imposing the same requirements for crowding resulted in
\ncompstardenominator\ stars for which rotation periods could have been
detected.
Imposing the same Lomb Scargle power cutoff, and period upper limit,
yielded \ncompstarnumerator\ period detections (\ncompfrac).
Within the same brightness cutoff, 
\nautovscompstarnumerator\ of \nautovscompstardenominator\ cluster stars
yielded period detections (\nautofrac).
Though the detection fractions are frankly not very different
(likely because of the brightness cutoff), the period {\it
vs} color distributions are quite different
(Figure~\ref{fig:compstar}).

Figure~\ref{fig:vproj} shows why the correct approach for comparing
any star's proper motions against the cluster's mean depends on the
position of the star being considered.

  \caption{ {\bf Gaia-based components of NGC\,2516 in position and
  velocity space, cross-matched against the rotators.} The plotted
  stars are those with $0.5<(Bp-Rp)_0<1.2$ that meet the crowding
  restrictions described in Section~\ref{subsec:tess}: they should
  have been sufficiently bright and non-crowded to enable rotation
  period detection.  We caution that the appearance of fewer
  non-rotators being present toward the core is due the layering of
  the plot: quantitatively, stars toward the cluster center do not all
  show rotation periods in our analysis (see
  Figure~\ref{fig:hist_physical_x_rotn}).

\end{figure*}

Figure~\ref{fig:gaia6d_x_rotn} is an alternative visualization of the
data shown in Figure~\ref{fig:physical_x_rotn}.  The rotation periods
in this diagram correspond to ``Set $\mathcal{A}$'' as described in
Section~\ref{subsec:tess}.  Many stars in the outer region of the
cluster show rotation periods consistent with a young age.  One issue
with the visualization as displayed however is that it hides the
amount of non-rotators toward the cluster center: we did not detect
rotation periods for roughly one in four stars at the cluster
center (see Figures~\ref{fig:physical_x_rotn}
and~\ref{fig:hist_physical_x_rotn}).
