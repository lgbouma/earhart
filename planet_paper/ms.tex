\section{Introduction}

Lorem ipsum.

Section~\ref{sec:observations} describes the identification of the
candidate, and the follow-up observations that led to its confirmation.

The planet can only be understood with respect to its (putative)
host cluster, so in turn we analyze the
available six-dimensional positions and kinematics (Section~\ref{sec:gaia6d}),
the rotation periods of stars in \cn\ 
(Section~\ref{sec:rotation}), and the available lithium measurements
(Section~\ref{sec:lithium}).
We synthesize this data in
Section~\ref{sec:system} to present our best interpretation of the
system itself, in turn presenting our interpretation of the
cluster
(Section~\ref{subsec:cluster}), the star (Section~\ref{subsec:star})
and the planet (Section~\ref{subsec:planet}).  We conclude in
Section~\ref{sec:discussion} by discussing which questions we have
been able to answer, and which remain open.



\section{Identification and Follow-up Observations}
\label{sec:observations}


  \subsection{TESS Photometry}
  \label{subsec:tess}
  TESS: S7 + S9

  \subsection{Gaia Astrometry and Imaging}
  \label{subsec:gaia}
  Gaia:
    Within 20 arcsec, there are three sources. 

  % 5489726768531119616 (target, G=13.02, plx=2.38 +/- 0.017 mas, so Bp-Rp=1.00).
  %   Note RV = 27.77km/s, +/- 9.99 km/s. Quotes E(Bp-Rp) = 0.1925

  % 5489726768531118848 (G=17.59, Bp=17.7, Rp=16.2, Bp-Rp=1.502,...
  %   but has plx=2.32 +/- 0.118 mas, and VERY SIMILAR proper motions. So, it's a
  %   binary. Presumably this is the companion that Ziegler found.)

  % There's also 5489726768531122560, a G=19.5 companion at further sep.

  % ...

  % Within 30 arcsec, there are... 8 sources. The others don't have parallaxes or
  % proper motions of significant interest.

  \subsection{High-Resolution Imaging}
  \label{subsec:speckle}
  Howell et al took some, for me, and had a non-detection.

  Also, Ziegler et al took some.
    They get the 2.1 arcsec separation, faint companion.

  \subsection{Ground-based Time-Series Photometric Follow-up}
  \label{subsec:groundphot}
  LCOGT
    5 light curves. 3 i band, 1 g band, 1 z band
  El Sauce
    1 r band.

  \subsection{Spectroscopic Follow-up}
  \label{subsec:spectra}

  \subsubsection{SMARTS 1.5$\,$m / CHIRON}
  \label{subsec:chiron}
  CHIRON x1 recon 2020-02-04, another circa 2021.

  \subsubsection{PFS}
  PFS template + RVs

  %\input{TOI837_rv_table.tex}

\section{Kinematics}

  \subsection{NGC 2516 broadly}
  \subsection{TOI 1937 specifically}
  If you back-integrate 20 Myr, it gets closer. But then, it gets
  further.

\section{Rotation}

  \subsection{NGC 2516 broadly}
  \subsection{TOI 1937 specifically}

\section{Lithium}

  \subsection{NGC 2516 broadly}
  \subsection{TOI 1937 specifically}

\section{System Modeling}
\label{sec:system}


\subsection{The Cluster}
\label{subsec:cluster}

\subsubsection{Physical Characteristics}
\label{subsec:clusterchar}

\subsubsection{HR Diagram}
\label{subsec:hr}

\subsection{The Star}
\label{subsec:star}

\subsubsection{Membership of \tn\ in \cn}
\label{subsec:member}

\subsubsection{Rotation}

\subsubsection{Lithium}

\subsubsection{Stellar Parameters}
\label{subsec:starparams}

\subsection{The Planet}
\label{subsec:planet}


\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

The future:
- Detailed multi-abundance modelling.
  i.e,. Get spectra of other cluster stars using PFS, and compare the metallicities.
- 2$\farc$5 separate, multiband imager. (With LCOGT, 2m in Australia,
  z-band)->Do PSF fitting.
- K-band image. MagAO? Multicolor imager.
- Maybe GROND -- has K-band. At La Silla. On 2.2m.  griz+K.
