\subsection{Description of the system, and available broadband photometry}

The TOI 1937 system consists of at least two stars. The primary, A, has an
effective temperature slightly greater than the Sun ($T_{\rm eff} \approx 5800
\, {\rm K}$). In terms of its brightness, $G = 13.02 \pm 0.XX$.

The detected secondary, B, is significantly fainter. Its apparent separation
from the primary is 2.1$''$, and it is reported both in the Gaia source catalog
(Gaia DR2 5489726768531118848), and was recovered in SOAR speckle imaging
(Figure~\ref{fig:speckle}).
In terms of its brightness, $G = 17.59$, and its parallax agrees with the
primary within the $1$$\sigma$ uncertainties.  Its proper motions agree within
$\approx 3 \sigma$ uncertainties.
Its apparent separation translates to a physical separation of at least
$\approx 1000\,{\rm AU}$ (2.1$''$ at $\sim$400$\,$pc).

The Gaia colors of the primary are consistent with the spectroscopic results, {\it
i.e.}, that it has a spectral type of G2V, and is consistent with being on or
near the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS).

The Gaia colors of the secondary are more ambiguous. While the Gaia processing
pipeline calculates the G-band fluxes from Gaia's high-resolution images, the
Rp and Bp fluxes are calculated from low dispersion spectra passed through a
prism, which means they include the light over a $3.5'' \times 2.1''$ area of
the sky, with no attempt made at de-blending.
Therefore, contamination from the primary is a concern for the Gaia Bp and Rp
fluxes.
The \texttt{phot\_bp\_rp\_excess\_factor} of 2.06 for the companion supports this
concern\footnote{\url{https://gea.esac.esa.int/archive/documentation/GDR2/Data_processing/chap_cu5pho/sec_cu5pho_qa/ssec_cu5pho_excessflux.html}};
in other words the summed Bp and Rp band fluxes for the companion are
significantly larger than expected based on the G band flux.
The Bp flux measurement in particular is concerning, as it is reported at a S/N
ratio of 5.4, in comparison to 89.5 for the Rp-band flux, and 244.3 for the
G-band flux.
One possible explanation for stars in this region of the HR diagrams that has
been proposed is that they are binaries consisting of white-dwarf plus M-dwarf
pairs (e.g., CITE: BELUKUROV 2020).
While the explanation is hard to rule out, the blending explanation seems more
plausible, since we know that it should be a concern for this system.

So, perhaps it should not come as a surprise that Figure~\ref{fig:MG_vs_BpmRp},
an HR diagram of $M_{\rm G}$ against $(Bp-Rp)$ shows the companion being bluer
than expected given its absolute $G$-band magnitude.
An HR diagram of $M_{\rm G}$ against $(G-Rp)$ (Figure~\ref{fig:MG_vs_GmRp})
seems to not show such a discrepancy, however as discussed above blending
remains a potential source of concern for the Rp-band flux due to the Gaia
DPAC's reduction procedure.

\paragraph{SOAR Photometry}
An important additional point of information regarding the color of the
companion therefore comes from the only other high-resolution image we
currently have of it apart from Gaia, obtained using the SOAR HRCam.  SOAR
showed the companion being 4.3 Cousins-I band magnitudes fainter than the
primary. 

\subsection{Broadband photometry SED fitting}

For the primary, we have APASS BVgri, DENIS Ic (included specifically to use
with the SOAR delta-Ic measurement), 2MASS JHKs, and WISE1-3 in addition to the
three Gaia bands. 
This gives

Primary 
reduced chi2 = 1.1 
Teff = 6100 +/- 150 K 
Fe/H = -0.5 +/- 0.25 
Av = 0.83 +/- 0.04 
Rstar = 1.095 +/- 0.055 Rsun 
Mstar = 1.07 +/- 0.06 Msun (Torres relations) 

For the secondary, we have only Gaia-G and SOAR Cousins-I. These give:

Secondary (assumed same Av and Fe/H as above) 
Teff = 3700 +/- 100 K 
Rstar = 0.444 +/- 0.066 Rsun 

if we fix the metallicity and reddening to be the same as for the primary.


\subsection{Resulting Stellar Properties}

The primary is easy, and is discussed elsewhere.

Implications for the secondary from available data are as follows.
If we believe Rp, then (G-Rp)\_0 ~= 1.22, which according to Mamajek's tables
would imply SpType M3.5V-M4V (0.22-0.26 Msun), not K3-K4V. The possible "K
dwarf interpretation" is wrong, because it is based off the (Bp-Rp) color, and
as noted above Bp seems off.  The (dereddened) Absolute G magnitude of 9.4 is
consistent with a ~M2V dwarf, which perhaps is the most reliable given the lack
of deblending, even in the Rp magnitude.

According to Mamajek, M2V would imply Rstar 0.434 Rsun, Mstar 0.44 Msun. It
would also imply Teff = 3550 K.

Teff of 3700K, which we got from Stassun's SED fitting, is more like M1V (0.496Rsun, 0.49Msun).

However given the uncertainties, it seems unlikely that broadband SED fitting
will be a path toward better characterization of the secondary, unless we can
get NIR speckle imaging to fill out the secondary SED..
